                  Website redesign involves updating and improving your existing website's design, functionality, and
                  performance while preserving valuable content and SEO elements. Unlike building a new website from
                  scratch, redesign focuses on enhancing what already works while fixing what doesn't, ensuring you
                  don't lose your search rankings or existing traffic.
