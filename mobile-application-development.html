          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Flutter is Google's open-source UI toolkit that allows developers to create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. You should choose Flutter for faster development cycles, consistent UI across platforms, excellent performance, and reduced development costs while maintaining high-quality user experiences."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Flutter apps deliver near-native performance because they compile directly to ARM machine code. The framework uses Skia graphics engine for rendering, which provides smooth 60fps animations and eliminates performance bottlenecks common in other cross-platform solutions."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": " Yes, Flutter provides extensive plugin ecosystem that enables access to native device features including camera, GPS, accelerometer, biometric authentication, push notifications, and more. If a plugin doesn't exist, custom platform channels can be created to access any native functionality."
