                    Joomla is a powerful, open-source Content Management System (CMS) that excels in building complex, feature-rich websites with advanced user management capabilities. Unlike WordPress, which focuses on simplicity, Joomla offers more sophisticated built-in features like advanced Access Control Lists (ACL), native multilingual support, and flexible content types, making it ideal for complex portals, membership sites, and corporate websites.
